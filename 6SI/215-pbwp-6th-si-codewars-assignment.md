# Assignment: PBWP 4th SI: Codewars assignment

Practice makes perfect. In this assignment, we would like you to practice some more Codewars katas.

## Your task

You have to collect at least 10 points by completing a _subset_ of the katas below. We count point as follows:
8 kyu kata scores 1 point,
7 kyu kata scores 2 points and
6 kyu kata scores 4 points.

**Example** : If you complete the Spelling bee (6 kyu) and Find twins (7 kyu) and Functional Addition (7 kyu) and Find Multiples of a Number (8 kyu) and String Repeat (8 kyu) then you score 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 10 points.


[](http://www.codewars.com/kata/tribonacci-sequence/train/python)Of course you can do more, no one will blame you ;)

For practice and getting more familiar with Python tricks, we suggest you _check the solutions_ (after completing a kata), understand the top-ranked ones and rewrite your code from scratch based on the new insight.

### Canvas submission

Remember to submit the final solution, in order to complete this assignment. When ready, please create a screenshot or multiple screenshots from the following page (view profile/solutions):

**The screenshots should contain ALL the solutions for the all the completed katas.**
